I earned my PhD in Developmental Psychology from the University of Minnesotaâ€™s Institute of Child Development under the mentorship of Dr. Melissa Koenig. Prior to my doctoral training, I received a B.S. in Psychology and a B.A. in Philosophy from Arizona State University. 

During my undergraduate studies, I became fascinated with understanding the mind, knowledge acquisition, and cognition, which led me to explore the development of a theory of mind as well as how young children acquire knowledge about the world. During my graduate training, I conducted several studies examining theory of mind and other social cognitive skills like executive functioning and selective trust in testimony. Driven to better understand how these developmental capacities are used by children in different contexts, I began to investigate selective learning and extensions of trust in more nuanced ways, including distinguishing between epistemic (knowledge-based) trust and interpersonal (social-based) trust and exploring trust and learning in applied settings (e.g., early childcare). 

As a postdoctoral trainee, I work with an interdisciplinary group of scholars who are committed to translating research to practice. Our transdisciplinary approach involves community members as active collaborators and co-creators of our science. I currently work on several projects that seek to infuse playful learning opportunities in public and educational settings. These projects align with my interest in supporting strong learning outcomes for all children, who learn from trusted sources in their lives like caregivers and teachers, with my goal of increasing access and representation in developmental science.
