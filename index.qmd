Annelise Pesch is a postdoctoral research fellow at Temple University. She is working with [Dr. Kathy Hirsh-Pasek](https://kathyhirshpasek.com/) on the expansion of Playful Learning Landscapes to Santa Ana, California in collaboration with Drs.

Dr. Pesch has expertise in children's social cognitive development, social learning, learning through play, and community-based participatory research. Her research investigates mechanisms that support strong learning outcomes and academic success for pre-kindergarten and elementary aged children. Her work explores how to support positive learning and socio-emotional skills as adults and children interact in formal and informal learning environments, with a specific focus on the role that trust plays in fostering high-quality interactions and learning outcomes. She aims to use her work to inform policy and practice.
