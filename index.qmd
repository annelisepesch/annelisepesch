I am a developmental scientist studying social cognitive development in early childhood. Iâ€™m currently a postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Psychology and Neuroscience at Temple University where I work on several research projects that aim to translate developmental research to practice in culturally responsive ways. My research interests include selective trust, theory of mind, executive functioning, social-emotional learning, and learning through play.
