I am a developmental scientist studying social and cognitive development in early childhood. Currently, I am a postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Psychology and Neuroscience at Temple University. Prior to joining Temple University, I earned my PhD in Developmental Psychology from the University of Minnesotaâ€™s Institute of Child Development. I also hold a B.S. in Psychology and a B.A. in Philosophy from Arizona State University.
