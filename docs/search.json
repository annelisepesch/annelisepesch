    "text": "I earned my PhD in Developmental Psychology from the University of Minnesota’s Institute of Child Development under the mentorship of Dr. Melissa Koenig. Prior to my doctoral training, I received a B.S. in Psychology and a B.A. in Philosophy from Arizona State University.\nDuring my undergraduate studies, I became fascinated with understanding the mind, knowledge acquisition, and cognition, which led me to explore the development of a theory of mind as well as how young children acquire knowledge about the world. During my graduate training, I conducted several studies examining theory of mind and other social cognitive skills like executive functioning and selective trust in testimony. Driven to better understand how these developmental capacities are used by children in different contexts, I began to investigate selective learning and extensions of trust in more nuanced ways, including distinguishing between epistemic (knowledge-based) trust and interpersonal (social-based) trust and exploring trust and learning in applied settings (e.g., early childcare).\nAs a postdoctoral trainee, I work with an interdisciplinary group of scholars who are committed to translating research to practice. Our transdisciplinary approach involves community members as active collaborators and co-creators of our science. I currently work on several projects that seek to infuse playful learning opportunities in public and educational settings. These projects align with my interest in supporting strong learning outcomes for all children, who learn from trusted sources in their lives like caregivers and teachers, with my goal of increasing access and representation in developmental science."

When children acquire a Theory of Mind, they achieve new capabilities to think about the mental states of others (e.g., beliefs, desires, intentions). Executive functioning skills provide children with opportunities to exercise inhibitory control, cognitive flexibility, and self-regulation. Projects of mine examine children’s acquisiton of a representational theory of mind and the ways in which theory of mind and EF are related.\nPapers:\n\nFabricius, W.V., Gonzales, C.R., Pesch, A., Weimer, A.A.

Using community-based participatory design and participatory action research practices, we created a series of playful installations that will be installed in several community spaces (parks, bus stops, and a grocery store) later this year. We are collecting observational and survey data to understand how the activities impact caregiver-child interactions and neighborhood well-being.\nPlayful learning landscapes in early childcare centers in Philadelphia, PA: With colleagues at the Temple Infant and Child Laboratory, we are infusing ECE settings with playful learning activities that foster early STEM and literacy learning. Activities were co-designed with educators and community members. We are investigating how the activities impact learning and classroom quality using individual student assessments, naturalistic observations, and teacher surveys.\nPerceptions of Storytime. We are investigating how interactions interrupted by technology (technoference) impact preschool-aged children’s selective trust and learning. Findings will provide initial evidence regarding the impact of technology use during contingent social interactions."

My research advocates for children's learning through play and argues that relationships are the foundation of strong learning outcomes. Playful learning is not just for kids – it's also a powerful pedagogical approach for teaching at the university level. My teaching goals are thus reflective of active learning, discovery-based learning, or flipped classroom pedagogies that reduce the amount of time spent lecturing in favor of hands-on activities.
