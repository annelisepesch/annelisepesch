    "text": "Broadly, my research examines preschool-aged children’s social cognitive development including social learning, trust in testimony, theory of mind, learning through play, and executive functioning. I conduct basic and applied research on these topics. Experimental work of mine examines how the distinct reasons children have to trust others impacts learning from different informational sources (e.g., caregivers, teachers) as well as how technology use during interactions impacts extensions of trust. Applied work of mine leverages what we know about how children learn and what children learn to accomplish two things. First, to evaluate how children’s trust in teachers can support academic and socio-emotional outcomes and second, to promote high quality teacher-child and caregiver-child interactions in formal and informal learning spaces.\nMy work is published in peer-reviewed scientific journals such as Frontiers in Psychology - Educational Psychology, Early Education and Development, Frontiers in Psychology - Cognitive Psychology, Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development, Journal of Experimental Child Psychology, PLOSone, and Current Directions in Psychology."

She is working with Dr. Kathy Hirsh-Pasek on the expansion of Playful Learning Landscapes to Santa Ana, California in collaboration with Drs. Andres Bustamante and June Ahn at the University of California, Irvine. Dr. Pesch has expertise in children’s social cognitive development, social learning, learning through play, and community-based participatory research. Her research investigates mechanisms that support strong learning outcomes and academic success for pre-kindergarten and elementary aged children. She explores how to support positive learning and socio-emotional skills as adults and children interact in formal and informal learning environments, with a specific focus on the role that trust plays in fostering high-quality interactions and learning outcomes. She aims to use her work to inform policy and practice. Dr. Pesch holds a Ph.D. in Developmental Psychology from the University of Minnesota’s Institute of Child Development, a B.A. in Philosophy from Arizona State University, and a B.S. in Pyschology from Arizona State University."

When children acquire a Theory of Mind, they achieve new capabilities to think about the mental states of others (e.g., beliefs, desires, intentions). Executive functioning skills provide children with opportunities to exercise inhibitory control, cognitive flexibility, and self-regulation. Projects of mine examine children’s acquisiton of a representational theory of mind and the ways in which theory of mind and EF are related.\nPapers:\n\nFabricius, W.V., Gonzales, C.R., Pesch, A., Weimer, A.A.
